## Overview

This document tracks testing implementation for the BackApp backup management system as part of Phase 6.2 (Testing & Quality Assurance).

---

## Testing Infrastructure

### ✅ Setup Complete

**Test Frameworks**:
- ✅ Jest (v29.7.0) - Unit and integration testing
- ✅ Playwright (v1.45.0) - E2E testing
- ✅ @testing-library/react - Component testing
- ✅ @testing-library/jest-dom - DOM matchers

**Configuration**:
- ✅ `jest.config.js` - Path aliases, coverage thresholds (70%)
- ✅ `playwright.config.ts` - Multi-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile)
- ✅ `tests/setup.ts` - Environment setup, mocks, global utilities

**NPM Scripts**:
```bash
npm test              # Run all Jest tests
npm test:unit         # Run unit tests only
npm test:integration  # Run integration tests
npm test:e2e          # Run Playwright E2E tests
npm test:watch        # Watch mode for development
npm test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
npm test:ci           # CI mode with coverage
```

---

## Test Suites Implemented

### ✅ Authentication Service Tests
**File**: `src/lib/auth/__tests__/auth-service.test.ts`
**Status**: ✅ Complete (18/18 passing)
**Coverage Areas**:
- User registration with security validations
- Password strength requirements (12+ chars, complexity)
- Credential validation and bcrypt verification
- User profile management (CRUD operations)
- Password change with current password verification
- Email uniqueness validation
- Account approval workflow
- Security policy enforcement

**Key Test Cases**:
```typescript
describe('registerUser')
  ✓ should successfully register a new user
  ✓ should throw error if user already exists
  ✓ should throw error if password is too short (< 12 chars)
  ✓ should throw error if password lacks uppercase
  ✓ should throw error if password lacks lowercase
  ✓ should throw error if password lacks numbers

describe('validateCredentials')
  ✓ should return user if credentials are valid
  ✓ should return null if user does not exist
  ✓ should return null if password is invalid

describe('changePassword')
  ✓ should successfully change password
  ✓ should throw error if user not found
  ✓ should throw error if current password is incorrect
  ✓ should throw error if new password is too short
  ✓ should throw error if new password lacks complexity
```

**Run Tests**:
```bash
npm test -- src/lib/auth/__tests__/auth-service.test.ts
```

**Results**: All 18 tests passing ✅

### 🔄 WebSocket Security Tests
**File**: `src/lib/websocket/__tests__/websocket-service.test.ts`
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress (5/16 passing - needs mock refinement)
**Coverage Areas**:
- Browser client pre-authentication (session validation)
- UserId override prevention (anti-impersonation)
- Cross-user data leakage prevention
- Agent vs browser authentication flows
- Message routing and broadcasting
- Error handling (malformed messages, disconnections)
- Ping/pong keep-alive mechanism

**Key Security Tests**:
```typescript
describe('Browser Client Security')
  ✓ should auto-authenticate browser clients with validated userId
  ✓ should prevent userId override for pre-authenticated clients

describe('Cross-User Data Leakage Prevention')
  ✓ should NOT allow browser client to receive messages for different user
  ✓ should only send messages to authenticated clients

describe('Agent Client')
  ✓ should authenticate agent with userId and agentId
  ⚠ should reject agent authentication without agentId (needs mock fix)
```

**Issues**:
- WebSocket.OPEN constant not properly mocked
- Buffer handling in message tests needs adjustment
- Will refactor to integration test approach

## Coverage Goals

**Target Coverage**: 70% (configured in jest.config.js)

**Current Coverage**: Not yet measured

**Coverage Priorities**:
1. **Critical Path**: Authentication, backup flow, S3 operations - 90%+
2. **Security Layer**: API auth, session management, access control - 85%+
3. **Business Logic**: Config management, scheduling, alerts - 70%+
4. **UI Components**: Dashboard, forms, history - 60%+

**Generate Coverage Report**:
```bash
npm test:coverage
```

## Testing Best Practices

### Followed in This Project

1. **AAA Pattern** (Arrange-Act-Assert)
   ```typescript
   it('should reject weak passwords', async () => {
     // Arrange
     const weakPassword = 'short';

     // Act & Assert
     await expect(
       authService.registerUser({ password: weakPassword, ... })
     ).rejects.toThrow('Password must be at least 12 characters long');
   });
   ```

2. **Mocking External Dependencies**
   - Prisma client mocked to avoid database hits
   - Bcrypt mocked for deterministic password hashing
   - WebSocket connections mocked for unit tests

3. **Test Isolation**
   - `beforeEach` clears all mocks
   - Each test is independent
   - No shared state between tests

4. **Descriptive Test Names**
   - Clear "should..." statements
   - Behavior-focused, not implementation-focused
   - Grouped by functionality (describe blocks)

5. **Security-First Testing**
   - All security fixes have corresponding tests
   - Negative test cases (what should fail)
   - Boundary testing (edge cases)

---

## Integration Testing Strategy

### API Endpoint Testing

**Approach**: Integration tests with real Next.js request handlers

**Example Structure**:
```typescript
describe('POST /api/agent/backup/start', () => {
  it('should reject unauthenticated requests', async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/agent/backup/start', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ configId: 'test' })
    });
    expect(response.status).toBe(401);
  });

  it('should validate agent ownership of config', async () => {
    // Agent tries to start backup for config owned by different agent
    // Should return 404
  });

  it('should generate valid pre-signed URL', async () => {
    // Successful backup start
    // Verify URL format, expiration, S3 path
  });
});
```

### Database Integration

**Approach**: Use test database for integration tests

**Setup**:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5433/backupdb_test
```

**Migrations**: Run Prisma migrations in test environment

---

## E2E Testing Strategy

### Critical User Journeys

1. **New User Onboarding**
   - Register → Verify email → Login → Dashboard
   - Install agent → Create first backup config
   - Run backup → View results

2. **Daily Backup Operations**
   - Login → View scheduled backups
   - Manually trigger backup
   - Monitor progress (real-time via WebSocket)
   - Check backup logs

3. **Multi-Agent Management**
   - Add second agent
   - Configure separate backup paths
   - Verify isolation (can't see other agent's backups)

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Simulate backup failure
   - Verify alert creation
   - Acknowledge alert
   - Retry backup

### E2E Test Infrastructure

**Playwright Configuration**: `playwright.config.ts`

**Browsers Tested**:
- Chromium (Desktop)
- Firefox (Desktop)
- WebKit (Safari)
- Mobile Chrome (Pixel 5)
- Mobile Safari (iPhone 12)

**Test Parallelization**: Enabled

**Screenshots**: Captured on failure

**Traces**: Captured on first retry

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Scenarios

1. **Concurrent Backups**
   - 10 simultaneous backup operations
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Check for race conditions

2. **Large File Uploads**
   - Test with 1GB, 5GB, 10GB files
   - Verify multipart upload handling
   - Check progress reporting accuracy

3. **WebSocket Scalability**
   - 100 concurrent WebSocket connections
   - Message broadcasting performance
   - Connection cleanup on disconnect

### Performance Tools

- **Artillery** (HTTP load testing)
- **Clinic.js** (Node.js profiling)
- **Chrome DevTools** (Frontend profiling)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Security-First Approach**: Writing tests for security fixes immediately after implementation
2. **Comprehensive Auth Tests**: Covering both happy path and edge cases
3. **Clear Test Structure**: AAA pattern makes tests easy to understand
4. **Mock Strategy**: Isolating database and external dependencies

### Challenges

1. **WebSocket Mocking**: Complex to mock WebSocket.OPEN constant
2. **Buffer Handling**: Message handlers expect Buffer, not string
3. **Async Operations**: Need careful handling of promises in tests

### Solutions

1. **WebSocket Tests**: Convert to integration tests with real WebSocket server
2. **Buffer Conversion**: Always use `Buffer.from()` for message data
3. **Async Testing**: Use `async/await` consistently, avoid mixing with promises
